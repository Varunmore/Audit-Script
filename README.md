# Server Audit Script

This script is designed to perform an audit on a server, collecting information about its hardware, software, and network configuration. The collected data is then archived into a single tar file with the hostname of the server appended to it.

## Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your server:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Varunmore/server-audit-script.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the directory of the cloned repository:

    ```
    cd server-audit-script
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```
    ./audit_script.sh
    ```

4. Upon completion, a tar file named `server_audit_hostname.tar` will be created in the current directory, containing the audit information.

## Contents of the Tar File

The tar file generated by the script will contain the following information:

- **Hardware Information**: Details about the server's hardware configuration (h.info).
- **Software Information**: List of installed software packages and their versions (s.info).
- **Network Configuration**: Network-related information such as IP addresses, routing tables, etc (i.info).

## Note

- This script may require elevated privileges to gather certain information. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions before running it.

- The generated tar file will contain sensitive information about your server. Handle it with care and ensure it is stored securely.

- Please review the script (`audit_script.sh`) before running it to ensure it meets your security and compliance requirements.
